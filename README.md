## Stuff From Class

If you'd like to review the solution to a problem we did in class,
they are posted organized by week and day in the `classwork` folder.

## Assignments

Each assignment has the following format:

Date given: description. Due date. Assignment name.

The due date means before class on that date. So if a homework is due
on 7/17, then it is due before 230PM on 7/17.

For any assignment where I ask you to solve a problem, please post
your solution in your github using the path
`cs/week#/day#/assignment-name`, where the week and day correspond to
the *due date* of the assignment. For example, assignment 3 would be
placed in `cs/week2/day1/hash-implementations`. 

### What if the problem is too hard?

If you are not able to solve the problem at home then post up a
text file containing the following:

- a description of the approach(s) you thought of
- a description of where you got stuck on these approaches. For
  example:
    - Was there a flaw in the approach you found and you had to think
      of a new one? What was the flaw? How did you try to get around
      it?
    - Were you just unable to implement the approach? Which part(s)
      were you unable to implement, and why?
- whatever part of a program you wrote if you wrote one

### Assignment Schedule

1. 07/16 (Tue): Read intro material on hash tables
   [here](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/) **Due
   7/17.**
2. 07/17 (Wed): You'll be emailed one of two problems. Solve the
   problem you're given in preparation for p2p whiteboarding. **Due
   7/19.** `ab-problem`
3. 07/19 (Fri): Finish reading intro material on hash tables if you
   haven't already, and complete the 1st two problems in the leetcode
   hash tables lessons: implement a hash set, and implement a hash
   map.  **Due 7/22.** `hash-implementations`
4. 07/22 (Mon): Solve [this
   problem](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/183/combination-with-other-algorithms/1105/)
   on leetcode. Remember to submit the solution on your personal
   repository. **Due 7/23.** `intersection-of-sets`
5. 07/23 (Tue): Solve [this
   problem](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/185/hash_table_design_the_key/1124/)
   on leetcode. Do your best, I'm intentionally giving you a harder
   problem. *Don't force yourself to spend longer than two hours on
   this problem.* If you solve it, post your program on your
   repository; if not, please post a text file containing a
   description of the approach you thought of, and whatever part of a
   program you wrote if you wrote one. We will go over this in class
   on 7/24. **Due 7/24.** `group-anagrams`.
6. 07/23 (Tue): Read the [lists review
   packet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ro83seOpzj7Yz4gcWz84qxg3CGhiArT8uB_xB9onZO0)
   and solve the following problem: given an array of numbers, `arr`,
   and a number from the array a number `k`, return the kth smallest
   number from `arr`. Another name for `k` is a number's *rank* in an
   array. A number has rank `k` if there are `k` many numbers in the
   array that are less than or equal to it. Another way of thinking
   about the rank of a number is the number's position in the sorted
   version of the array (if the array has no duplicates). Assume that
   your input will not have duplicates.  **Due 7/25.** `kth-smallest`.
7. 07/23 (Tue): Solve [contains duplicate
   ii](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/184/comparison-with-other-data-structures/1121/)
   on leetcode. We missed it in class, so I'm assigning it as
   homework. **Due 7/26.** `contains-duplicate-ii`.
8. 07/24 (Wed): Solve [find duplicate
   subtrees](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/185/hash_table_design_the_key/1127/)
   on LC and post your solution on github. **Due 7/29.**
   `duplicate-subtrees`.
9. 07/25 (Thu): Write a function to insert a range of entries from one
   array into another array. This is a HackerRank problem. **Due
   7/29.** `insert-range`.
10. 07/29 (Mon): Implement dutch national flag partitioning, but for a
    linked list. Solve it on HR. **Due 7/30.** `linked-list-pivoting`.
11. 07/30 (Tue): Read the [stacks and queues review packet]() and
    solve stacks and queues pre-work question on hackerrank. **Due 8/01.**
    `stacks+queues-pre-work`.
12. 07/30 (Tue): p2p problems for this friday! You will be invited to
    a hackerrank test containing your questions. Complete them by
    Friday. Half the class will get one set of questions, the other
    half will get another set of questions. **Due 8/2.** `ab-problems`.
13. 08/02 (Fri): Test if a string contains balanced brackets. You'll
    get an invitation to a HR test. **Due 8/5.** `balanced-brackets`.
